# APS-Arena - Rock Paper Scissors Game
RPS Arena is a Java command-line interface (CLI) application that allows players to play the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer or against another human player connected to the game's local server.

The game starts with the player selecting their game mode - single player against the computer or multiplayer against another human player. In single-player mode, the player competes against the computer, and in multiplayer mode, the player connects to the local server and competes against another human player.

The game features a simple and intuitive interface, with players selecting their move by entering a number that corresponds to their choice (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors). The game logic then determines the winner based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules.

This project serves as a demonstration of Java programming skills and provides a fun and interactive game experience for players. Whether you want to challenge yourself against the computer or compete with friends in multiplayer mode, RPS Arena offers an enjoyable way to play Rock Paper Scissors.
